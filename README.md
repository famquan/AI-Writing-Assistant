## What are AI writing tools?

AI writing tools generate copy and improve writing based on user prompts. You might input a paragraph into an AI writing tool asking it to pinpoint instances of passive voice, for example. It will then list each instance. Or you could ask for 10 email snippet suggestions for an email campaign, giving the tool enough information to offer an insightful response.

To offer good quality and human-like responses, these tools analyze large quantities of data, which dictates their impressions of what a good answer would be. Much of this data is accessed via web content, though, meaning AI writing tools don’t always provide accurate and ethical responses. Always audit the content you use from these platforms to ensure that it’s correct and aligns with your values.

## How can AI improve your writing?

Chances are you’re familiar with your word processor’s spellchecker. When you skip or misspell a word, this tool automatically fixes the error, or gives you the option to do so. AI writing tools work the same way, just with much more power behind them. AI tools can improve your copywriting by offering suggestions on the following:

-   **Grammar** — they can correct grammar mistakes you may not recognize or catch. While it may be common to hear a sentence like, “There were less people at the meeting this week,” that grammar is off, and an AI tool would likely catch it, correcting the sentence to read “fewer people.”
    
-   **Clarity**  — AI tools can recommend more precise sentences that cut out unnecessary descriptors and wordy syntax. An AI writing assistant might suggest “the company’s vision” instead of the clunkier and repetitive “the vision and dreams of the company.”
    
-   **Tone**  — these tools can understand a piece's style and recommend staying in a formal or friendly voice. An AI writing helper might flag academic language in an informal email and recommend a change, like switching out “facile” for “easy” or “simple.”
    
-   **Structure**  — a well-written document that doesn’t follow a logical structure can lose the reader. AI tools can suggest an outline that supports your ideas and encourages a logical flow of ideas.
    
-   **What to write next** —  an AI writing assistant can finish your sentences, write a first draft of an email, and summarize meeting notes or audio clips. If a teammate talks freely for 2–3 minutes about an upcoming development project, an AI tool can write down a salient point like, “The team will begin development on a wellness app next week.”
